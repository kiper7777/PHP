                Website Disclaimers
                Profitrade Ltd. (“We”, “Our”, “Us”, or “Company”) operates as a proprietary trading firm. The Company is
                not a custodian, exchange, financial institution, trading platform, fiduciary or insurance business
                outside the purview of financial regulatory authorities. “Profitrade” is a brand name operated by the
                Company.
                All trading activities conducted through the Company Hub are executed in a simulated environment. Users
                should be aware that the trading results in this environment do not reflect real trading outcomes. The
                simulated trading environment in the Hub is designed for educational and evaluation purposes only. The
                “funds” provided to you for the evaluation are fictitious, do not represent any currency, and that you
                have no right to possess those fictitious funds beyond the scope of their use within the Hub and for the
                sole purpose of the evaluation, and in particular that they may not and cannot be used for any actual
                trading and that you are not entitled to any payment or other right in or of those funds.
                Becoming a funded user is not guaranteed. The eligibility for becoming a funded user is contingent upon
                meeting specific performance criteria and compliance with the Company’s evaluation processes. Not all
                users will qualify for funded accounts, and past performance in the simulated environment is not
                indicative of future success.
                All content published and distributed by Us and Our affiliates is to be treated as general information
                only. None of the information provided contained herein is intended as (a) investment advice, (b) an
                offer or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell, or (c) a recommendation, endorsement, or sponsorship
                of any security, company, or fund. Testimonials appearing on the website may not be representative of
                other clients or customers and is not a guarantee of future performance or success. Use of the
                information contained on the website is at your own risk and the Company and its partners,
                representatives, agents, employees, and contractors assume no responsibility or liability for any use or
                misuse of such information.
                Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance
                record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, because the trades have not actually
                been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market
                factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs, in general, are also subject to the fact
                that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account
                will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.
